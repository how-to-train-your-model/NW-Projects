Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a well-known technique of artificial intelligence to extract the elements of concern from the raw plain text information. 
NLP is more than just understanding the words; it's like using mathematical calculations to find the right word that fits well into our discussion.

NLP has also become more focused on information extraction and generation in the last decade due to the vast amounts of information scattered across the Internet. 
One of the use cases of NLP is word/sentence embedding, and many tools/models available are pre-trained on a large volume of text, such as the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). 
Other technologies used in NLP are machine learning and deep learning.

Natural language processing (NLP) portrays a vital role in the research of emerging technologies. 
It includes sentiment analysis, speech recognition, text classification, machine translation, question answering, among others. 
A few of the most common use cases are chatbots, spam detection, clinical documentation (healthcare), etc.

A research paper from Carnegie Mellon University and Google Brain proposed a novel neural architecture known as Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed-length without disrupting temporal coherence. 
According to the researchers, TransformerXL learns dependency 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation.
